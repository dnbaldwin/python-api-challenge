Module 06 Challenge

PART 1: WeatherPy

The WeatherPy code was initially tested on a reduced dataset size of 50 (as compared 1500).
Code snippets from resources below were used to convert UNIX UTC timestamp data to a human readable abbreviated ISO format

Results of the graphical outputs and regression analyses are provided in the data_output folder

Individual graphs include the linear regression equation together with the r value, which provides information as to the direction of trend relationship between the x and y value datasets. In addition the R-squared value is given as a measure of how well the data fits the model.

A brief interpretation of the graphical results and regression analyses are included in the Jupyter notebook.


PART 2: VacationPy

VacationPy is reasonably self explanatory. The visual interpretation of the graphs suggests that most humid locations are coastal, which is to be expected. The cities with a maximum humidity of 85% were selected for vacations and hotels can be seen using the hover tool.
